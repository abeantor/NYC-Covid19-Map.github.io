# Description: 
One of the advantages we have today in the fight against coronavirus that big data and the high level of technology available. China tapped into big data, machine learning, and other digital tools as the virus spread through the nation in order to track and contain the outbreak. As the virus continues to spread across the world as other countries fight; we can use digital technology to develop real-time forecasts and arm healthcare professionals to predict the impact of the coronavirus.

Our primary goal is to create a web mapping with a listing of all of the people living in New York City. Using Data mapping to showcase the affected people in New York City by the zip code. Data Analytics, mapping, and geographic data of the affected people can find reasonable answers to why it affects some more than others, what measures can help reduce the spread, and where the disease will likely go next.
